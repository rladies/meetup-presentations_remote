## Speakers
### Afiqah Syamimi binti Masrani
<img src="https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_remote/blob/main/2021_whyR/afiqah.jpg" width="300">

#### Bio
Afiqah is in her first year as a student for Doctor of Public Health in Universiti Sains Malaysia, specializing in Occupational and Environmental Health.
She was previously affiliated to Negeri Sembilan State Health Department in the Surveillance and Communicable Disease Unit.
Recently she was part of the epidemiological team analysing the effect of the movement control order (MCO) on COVID-19 under the
Ministry of Science and Technology, Malaysia. 

#### Abstract
**Presentation ready tables for public health research with the {gtsummary} package in R** <br>
Summarizing data and analysis from public health research can be challenging for researchers with the immense data collected from different sources.
Accurate representation in tables are essential skills required to assist in shedding light on the influence of the determinants of health to population health.
The gtsummary package in R is a concise and highly customisable package that can be used to prepare presentation ready tables for both data summary and
analysis results. I will be sharing the application of gtsummary package in regression models for regression models frequently used in public health research
including cox-hazard analysis.

### Tulimegameno “Tuli” Amutenya

#### Bio
**Tulimegameno “Tuli” Amutenya** is from Namibia and works for Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) as a Data Processing Manager,
where she leads statistical data management activities including applications development, processing and data storage of all national surveys
such as census and administrative data. Prior to this role, she led the application development team as a senior applications analyst at NSA,
playing a key role in automating data collection and processing methods. Tuli obtained a Master of Science Degree in Data Science from
University of Salford in the United Kingdom, with support from the Chevening Scholarship Programme in 2019. Following her graduation from this programme,
she was integrated into a six-month mentorship programme under the International Development Unit at the Data Science Campus of the
National Statistics Office in Wales, UK. This was in an effort to promote partnership and collaboration between national statistics offices across the world,
toward integrating data science into statistical production. She is at her early career with R ,but excited to the future and growth of R community in Namibia.

#### Abstract
**Natural Processing Language (NLP) for Survey text data - other-specify variable** <br>
Survey comments and other specify variables demands a lot of processing time from statisticians and analysts.  In most occasions, survey questions are provided with  pre-defined options including text fields to enter other options not included in the list. Open text fields are not easy to analyse and statisticians spent a lot of time manually studying and re-coding these fields. In this session, we are demonstrating the use of NLP on a small survey data to recode other-specify variable values.

Using tools such as R and Machine learning can support survey data processing and eliminate manual processing/ recoding of these variables.

#### Abstract
**Using R and text mining to find a common ground for action in Polarized contexts** <br>
The lack of substantive freedom has led Venezuela to extreme poverty along with systematic social deprivations.
Common people are in shock, hopeless, and divided into two irreconcilable camps that have made nearly impossible to work together to find a way out of this crisis.
Searching a way to solve this social paralysis, the initiative in which I have been involved has brought together people from different locations, backgrounds,
and political ideologies, between November 2017 and July 2018, to question them about the country they like in 2030 as well as the kind of citizens, communities,
institutions, values, and projects needed to make true that preferred country. <br>
Using tidytext, tidyverse, widyr, igraph, wordcloud as well as basic R packages, along with gephi, I applied text mining to the opinion of
150 communities, 10 ONGs, about 80 undergraduate students from 4 universities and 10 experts and then extracted, discussed, and aggregated those findings
obtaining their dreamed Venezuela. They were able to literally visualize their opinions and, by looking at the emergent pattern of their thoughts, assess to
what extent their preferred country converged and/or diverged. They found that, in fact, there were more elements in common; consequently, they found that they
actually might work together. <br>
Very important topics were absent of this dreamed country, though. The connection between the fundamental role of liberty to sustainable development was
one of them. Despite the fact that participants emphatically talked about human rights, they seemed not to have realized that, for example, the denial of
political and civil liberties paves the way to systematic social deprivation, lack of economic opportunities, and not just to a repressive state.
